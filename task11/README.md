## Task11 "Class creation"

Add some new properties (color and material) to the Box class from the previous task. Implement a new constructor (in addition to the existing one) that will set all fields, also add getters and setters for each field. In constructors and setters add logic for setting height, width and length values - so that it is impossible to set a value less than or equal to zero.
