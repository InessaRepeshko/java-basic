## Task07 "Console calculator"

Write a console calculator using methods (write a method for each task):
1. You need to enter 2 numbers (can be integers) from the console. Essentially the method should be one - just use it 2 times to enter each number.
2. Enter an operation (+, -, \*, /).
3. Perform an operation on the two numbers.
4. Output the result of the operation to the console.
